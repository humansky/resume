My name is Henry Umansky and I'm applying for the position of Associate Director of Project Management. I have over 15 years of experience in Higher Education managing several projects, both large and small, and feel I would be a perfect fit for the position. My current career goal is to focus and grow my skillset in the area of project management, while
leveraging my experience with, and enjoyment of, IT related projects.

At my current position at Princeton University, I manage a team for the Web Development Services department in the Office of Information Technology. Over the course of the past 10 years of technical and managerial positions, I’ve developed competencies in project management, budgeting, communications, process development and implementation, user needs evaluation, requirements gathering, strategic planning, reporting and data visualization, research and analysis, and vendor management.

I am currently pursuing a Master degree in Technology Management at Columbia University with an expected date of graduate in December of 2016.

My passion for technology, combined with the thrill of seeing a successful project from start to finish, would make me an ideal candidate for this position.
